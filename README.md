# Spidey Quiz

## Description

The project was built to showcase knowledge of the 3 main pillars of front-end web development skills: HTML, CSS, & JavaScript and the interaction between all 3 of these. Also, to showcase use of the local storage skillset to save a name to a score in a leaderboard. The quiz that I built centers around basic knowledge of the superhero "Spider-Man". As a result, one could use the quiz to test their knowledge on the hero to ace an exam...or something. I built the quiz to attempt to prove to myself that I could which, for the most part, I succeeded. I learned how JavaScript could be used to dynamically change elements of the HTML based on user input, creating an interactive application. What I also learned, unfortuneately, was that I still definitely do not fully understand localStorage or JSON.
